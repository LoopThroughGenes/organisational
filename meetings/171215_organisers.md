## Status

- We are 16 certified instructors, around 16 helpers. This is quite a large community by SWC standards.

- In 2017 we have had thirteen one-day workshops, one 2-day workshop, plus 9 workshops at Research Bazaar. We have also had two Data Therapy sessions.

- People coming to the Therapy sessions actually brought specific problems. We believe people found the sessions helpful. We need to be better with getting correct info about these sessions
distributed. The library is hiring another person who should be able to help out with coordinating the organizing effort.

## Next term

- We have been given room 123, in Vilhelm Bjerknes' Hus, on thursdays, and plan workshops accordingly. We have a gap in March/April so are left with 14 days.

- Python and R work best as 2-day workshops. Most other workshops work well as 1 day events. We will try to split the 2-day workshops across weeks; several people have requested this. We have a
lot of workshops planned for Research Bazaar (ResBaz) 2018, see [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tOjwMJBvqhMJYQOOLVmLUbMjg_YC7yGiqmnU-gepXuc/edit#gid=355971114]-

- We will do two-day official Carpentry workshops the monday and tuesday immediately preceding the Research Bazaar. We need to find rooms, and consider officially extending the ResBaz to the whole week.

## Misc

- We need a carpentry@uio logo, partly because our workshops often don't meet all SWC critera fully and thus cannot really use the SWC logo.
We will use that logo for printed, web, Git and infoscreen material.
The library is on this.

- Other universities in Norway are interested in having Carpentry workshops. Library Carpentry has been invited to Bergen, instructors will travel from UiO, but Bergen will supply the helpers.

- We now have a _steering committee_ in place to make sure we are not so person-dependent on following up cases!
Lex Nederbragt, Michel Heeremans and Maryia Khomich are in the committee, as well as either Elin Stangeland or someone else from the library.

- Funding: How can we expand beyond UiO? Lex has had mixed results with Sigma2 and the HPC groups.
Libraries are running workshops in different places.
NSD [Norsk Senter for Forskningsdata](nsd.no) is getting new funding for Data management.
