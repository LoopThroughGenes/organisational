# Meeting minutes

- High demand of courses leads to learner/helper ratio being too low
	- Turn away people that haven’t registered
	- Upper cap for attendees: 35 people

- Fall 2017
	- A schedule for the fall will be sketched next meeting
	- Suggested: Data therapy sessions (bring your problem - get help and coffee)
		- There seems to be a demand for such a service
	- Rooms in the ground floor of Nils Henrik Abels hus might be booked for SWC every Wednesday, allows for more courses (with less people)

- Yearly report 2016
	- Need data from all workshops (who registered, who attended)
	- Suggested: In the future, a UiO-’nettskjema’  could be given to learners during the course, to get data on the learners that actually show up

Other:

- A resource for learning intermediate Python is sought after by some learners
- Instructors need to have two standard SWC/DC courses in the last two years to keep their certification, specialised courses doesn’t count
- Traveling to other universities to teach SWC/DC courses is possible, but we need to find local hosts
- Social night: Details to be worked out later, pizza in the park or booking a table at Kulturhuset (bar) was suggested.
