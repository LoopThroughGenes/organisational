all: yes

## About Carpentry@UiO


- All Carpentries@UiO activities are coordinated by the Science Library 

- UiO has Silver Carpentries membership

But we have difficulties to scale and maintain instructors involved in the Carpentry@UiO. We have about 20 instructors 
but only a few are teaching.

We need to contact UF Carpentries:

- can we copy their charter?

We need to choose a brand name:

Live: do not use Club as it is difficult to sell.

*Carpentry@UiO*

Live: It is important to involved **MN communication**


## Code of conduct (CoC)


needs to handle all the different types of workshop (Carpentries, Carpentries@UiO, Resbaaz) and we need to know how to escalate to University rules and policies.

Action point: contact UF Carpentry Club board to hear about how they handle CoV violations, and hwo this relates to the university's CoC (of any)
