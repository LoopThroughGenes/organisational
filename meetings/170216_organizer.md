#Carpentry week and Research Bazaar

##Feedback from this years event

- Merged UiO carpentry Week and Research Bazaar event
- Almost 250 registered people
- We are still missing the number of (real) attendees -> the library is working on the evaluation form -> workshop leaders need to send attendance sheets
- Only few people visited the stands -> maybe because it was in parallel with the workshops

##Carpentry week/RezBas 2018

- Start planning for 2018 event in August 2017
- Date ResBaz 2018: January/February 2018 
- More people need to get aware of us (all faculties at UiO + externals)
- If we have a program early enough we can get into different newsletters at UiO 
- We can create posters 
- Maybe have ambassadors at each faculty to get people informed
- Organize more diverse workshops --> reach a greater audience
- Have the information stands at the same time and place as the lunch or to get even greater attention to the stands have a designated day only for stands without workshops to help people and get them informed

# Instructor training and recruitment
##Instructor training

- Next instructor workshop in Oslo is planned for early August 2017 
- No pre-requirements needed to participate but it is advisable to be familiar with software/data carpentry and their teaching philosophy
- Post-requirements:
	- Finish workshop tasks within 90 days after finishing the course
	- Teach a SWC or DC course within a year after finishing the instructor workshop 

##Instructor recruitment

- Suggesting for recruiting new instructors:
	- "Headhunt" people directly
	- Have mentors ("old" instructors) that recruit new ones
	- Give instructors credits (in form of ETCS) for teaching (Lex is sceptical because he wants not to loose the "dugnad"-spirit)

# SWC Oslo future plans

## Data therapy

- Workshop instructors experienced that attendees stayed after the workshop to get specific help for their research projects
- In regular time-lags we could organize something called data therapy -> a couple of willing instructors help out other people with their computational problems

## Nordic Carpentry network

- In the future we plan to build a Nordic Carpentry network to get SWC and DC people together and stretch the workshops to new places
- Lex gives a workshop about the SWC model at [The Nordic e-Infrastructure Conference (NeIC 2017)](http://neic2017.nordforsk.org/workshops/software-carpentry/): May 29th - June 1st 2017
- In his workshop he is presenting how a Carpentry workshop is run by giving a short teaching session, he will talk about how the lesson material is created and how to become involved in SWC and an instructor
- If the money is sufficient for it, several UiO carpenters can join Lex and represent us
- A result from the NeIC can be that other countries/places are interested in giving Carpentry workshops and until they have their own certificated instructors we can help out with our instructors

## Carpentry and industry

- Find out if industry is interested in participating in SWC workshops
- Create ordinary workshops that are also heavily advertised outside the university -> see how many of the participants were from industry (we expect industry people to register faster to the workshops than university people)
- If industry interest is there: give workshops only for industry against a participant fee


# Next meeting
April 3rd, 2pm (90minutes), room: TBD
