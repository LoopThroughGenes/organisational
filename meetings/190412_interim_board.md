## Notes

### Action points from last meeting
- Name - status from Live included in web work. Invited UB communication crew pluss new centre project manager (Matthew Good). Meeting on the 23rd of April. The current web site have been updated somewhat: https://www.uio.no/english/for-employees/support/research/research-data/training/carpentry/ - error at bottom of page, ES to fix. Trude leaving by the end of August.

- Charter - Reviewed the charter - it needs more people reading through it, and potential tweaks. 

- Code of conduct - we are in a grey zone, as several sets of regulations apply (local vs. carpentry). Sending people away, potentially with the help from the UiO vaktsentral, should be fine according to the guidelines for  harassment policy. After workshop follow ups, we follow local guidelines. For official Carpentry code of conduct. 

- Instructor training - 26 people applied, 6 spots in the year that ends in april and 6 spots for the year that starts in may. 6 people have been offered a spot directly - and have been allocated date for course. 6 more people have been notified that they are to sign up when approved centrally. 4 people doing UiO contributed course in June - can join up activites. When training is complete - set up meeting regarding follow up activites. Potentially to be held in late June or after summer. ALso training courses in July and August. Ask Karin Lagesen to run this? 

### Regional coordinator Carpentries Nordics/Baltics
See https://carpentries.org/regionalcoordinators/. Neic and UB are positive, hoping to engage 100% person with funds covered by the two organisations. Sweden and Finland are seeing more activity, less so in Iceland and the Baltic? Aim to get workshops running in more places and to engage more instructors. Do Carpentry connect Nordic?

### New hires at the library
Offers have gone out. Matthew Good have accepted the project leader post for the Digital Scholarship centre. For the skills development job, an offer have gone out. Invite them to the next interim board meeting if they are available. 

### Elections
To happen in early fall, depends on Charter completed. Board can look at how to follow up instructors better. Social events, training etc. can be potential activites. 

### Upcoming workshops
Need to update Carpentry@UiO web site with link to study groups. ES to follow up on running more workshops before summer. 

### Question from Physics
Requesting Python courses, Anne have provided something like that for Geo, it would be possible to do something similar for Physics. Perhaps Tiago can, Henrik from UB might also be a resource here. Live will follow up. 

### Next meeting
Tentative: August 6th at 13:00. ES to email folks to check if the are available
