# Collaboration with AI HUB on AI training

Andrea Gasparini from the [AI hub](https://www.uio.no/tjenester/it/forskning/kompetansehuber/uio-ai-hub-node-project/) joined for this item.

The course [JUS5671](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/jus/jus/JUS5671/) has asked the AI hub for support. They would like 3 Fridays, (i) bootcamp on Programming with Python, (ii) Git(Hub) and Jupyter Notebooks, (iii) AI. Involved from AI: Hub Thomas Roeblitz, Anne Bergsaker and Andrea Gasparini; from JUS5671: Malcom Langford. Want to use this as a pilot towards workshops/courses to be offered to other institutes. Will reuse some of the material from the AI workshop during Research Bazaar. Suggestions from us: difficult to teach enough Python, can use Jupyter Notebook with AI relevant code that students study and modify; make sure what is in notebook is very relevant for students; skip git(hub); use tensor libraries available on Google (e.g. [Google collab](https://colab.research.google.com/)).

# Name

'Carpentry' does not realy convey the message of what we do.  However, Carpentry/Carpentries has become a brand. Maybe we can involve UX people and pilot some one-liners, name, website designs? It was suggested we ask the UiO library to come up with a communication strategy and name/slogan

**Decision**: We ask the UiO library to come up with a branding and communication strategy, including name/slogan.

**Action point**: Live to put in motion.

# Charter

Anne has worked on it and the first draft can be found here https://github.com/annefou/carpentry-UiO-docs and rendered version. We will use the github repo and issues functionality to discuss and finalise.

**Action points**:
* Anne to submit issues on questions she has.
* everyone to read through and come with comments


# Code of conduct (CoC)

What is the UiO 'code of conduct'? We discussed HMS and 'ombuds'.

**Action point**: Live to contact 'vernombudet' at UiO Library to find out how we can assure we use the right 'Code of Conduct' and reporting routines, and/or whether we can/should use our own, and how we can create the correct 'Incident response guidelines' etc.

# Elections

We wait with this until we have approved the charter.

# Instructors: training and community building

We have 26 signed up for instructor training (for 12 spots). In the near future, we need to set up an onboarding strategy for trainees and newly certified instructors.

**Action points**: Lex to suggest a ranking for those to be offered places and offer them,a suggest those that sign up for the same date to be in the same room together.

# Website

Moved to next meeting. This is also part of the communication effort.

# AOB (any other bussiness)

None.

# Next meeting
We did not decide on the next meeting time, this will be done by email.
