# SkypeMeetingUCdavis #

##########Notes Skype Meeting on Data Therapy UC davis (titus brown) 23May2016####
Using Google hangouts teaching remote eases access to larger group of teachers
Announce therapy sessions at every workshop
Every wednesday 2-5pm
#WHAT THEY DO (LESS WORK)
People work on their own stuff.
Have questions
2-3 people to help out.
A few (5) students per week
Repeated session for a while then drip of when schedule changes.
Problem: 
People dont always know why they would come. 
Solution:
Give people a reason to come. Make sure to have something in beginning. Start with lesson (Ex. How to use jupiter notebook)
Often quite lab(Titos) specific.

#WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO (MORE WORK)
Make appointements with titus
Go through past tutorials (passed workshops). They do more copy and paste than SWC (reaches futher?).
Be clear that anyone can come.
Would like a more broad spectrum.

My reflection: Have strategies for different number of people
With 1 person. 1 heavy topic
Many people - many light topics
