* **ACTION POINT**: run at least 1 official SWC/DC/LC workshop per year

* **ACTION POINT**: remove those from organizers list which do not actively engage anymore

* **ACTION POINT**: take personal (email) contact w/ those who did instructor training in 2019 and inform about their pledge to teach workshops

#### Nomination for Board Members

* The nettskjema for self-nominations for the new Board has been created (ES & AF) and was sent out for review to the members of the Interim Board

### New Business

#### Research Bazaar

#### StudyGroup

## Survey

- 21 replies
- https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/reporting/report_instructor-status-survey_2019-11-07.md
- few answers from new instructors
- 13 instructors at UiO but not full overlap with what is displayed on the [Carpentries website](https://carpentries.org/instructors-map/)

#### Important outcomes:

- Most instructors can teach the standard Software Carpentry subjects. 
- Much less for Data Carpentries (no for social sciences: we should try to recruit new instructors for covering new topics).

- Still a few instructors do not know how to organize a workshop at UiO but a majority can (thanks to on-bording sessions at the beginning of the year). We will organize new on-boarding sessions next year (Annika).

- Because we do not run official Carpentries workshops so we are not well represented on the Carpentries website. Instructors can loose their instructor certification.

**Remark**: Annika sent an email to instructors@carpentries.org to keep her instructor certificate. This task could be done by Naoe (send a list of who has taught one or two days or whatever workshops to Carpentries).

- Only 4 responses from new instructors. A few are certificed but many are not certified yet. We need to follow up.

Discussion on how to get commitments from future instructors but no agreement on the way forward.

### Action points

- (All): Run at least one official workshop per year
- (Annika): GDPR --> all our mailing lists need to be updated (ask members to confirm their subscription).

- (Naoe): Ask those who attended NeIC workshop "FAIR data stewardship: Supporting FAIR data interoperability" to join our mailing list (organizer)
- (Annika):  Run a new onboarding session in January (mid-january).
- Work for new board: review and select instructor applications (April 2020).
