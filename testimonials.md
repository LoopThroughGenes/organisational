**Learner 1:**

Thanks to everyone involved in making the Software Carpentry Workshops happen. 
They have been such an inspiration for me, and a truly powerful tool for learning how to program. 
Git, Shell, loops and code is something that has never been a part of my curriculum, 
but that I use every day as a struggling science-noob. 
Looking forward to many more (FREE!!) workshops, and will recommend you to the entire
department if I can.

**Learner 2:** 

Thank you for slowing down and be incredible patience with slow learners like me. Your ennounsiation and pronunciation was just perfect for hard of hearing people and the instructor really infused me enthusiasm in the end even if we should had an extra 30 minutes to finish. Perfect in every aspect. From 1 to 10 this was 9 in my opinion. When you take it slow you open this for everyone, and that is crucial to build interdiciplinary and collaborative strong culture.
