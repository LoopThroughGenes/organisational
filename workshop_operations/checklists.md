# General

* these checklists are in addition to the ones [provided by The Carpentries](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/index.html) for their official workshops - note that not all workshops at UiO are official The Carpentries workshops
* It is preferred to use the `Bcc` field for sending email to participants - that way we protect participants' privacy by not displaying  email addresses to all recipients.
* email lists:
  * ``carpadmin @ swcarpentry dot uio dot no`` --> University Library and some instructors
  * ``organizers @ swcarpentry dot uio dot no`` --> all instructors and helpers, plus those on the admin list
  * ``announcements @ swcarpentry dot uio dot no`` --> all people that have shown interest or have attended workshops + those on the organisers list

# Lead instructor

## Initial Preparation

* contact ``organizers @ swcarpentry dot uio dot no`` to get the link for the planning spreadsheet and fill in your name in the column "Lead instructor / responsible" for the available dates that fit you
* add your name to the instructor list under "List values - instructors" below the planning schedule and fill check the appropriate boxes in the Instructors sheet
* send a call for co-instructors and helpers to the ``organizers @ swcarpentry dot uio dot no`` list and ask them to sign up in the spreadsheet
* NOTE: a full-day workshop can only be confirmed if at least two instructors have signed up in the spreadsheet
* To generate the workshop website at uio-carpentry dot github dot com:
  1) make sure you are a member of uio-carpentry, the [uio-carpentry github organisation](https://github.com/orgs/uio-carpentry/people). If you aren't, send an email to carpadmin @ swcarpentry.uio.no with your GitHub username to invite you.
  2) create the webpage using the template from https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template. NOTE: as the repository name, *use YYYY-MM-DD-uio* (using the correct date) and not python/R/oslo... or any other text, and *choose the organisation uio-carpentry as owner* for the workshop repository when you import the template. (If needed, ownership can be transferred later)
* Submit a self-organized workshop to Carpentry central from [this form](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/self-organised/).     Note: If you're running a one-day workshop, choose *Short session (less than two days)*, and UiO workshops are usually public, so please choose *This event is open to the public*. You may add your co-instructors'/helpers' email addresses in the last field where you are asked about communication.
  The Regional Coordinator will then register instructor information at the Carpentry's sytem as well as make workshop information visible on Carpentry website. 
* organise pre-workshop meeting with the other instructors and the helpers to go through lesson materials etc.

## A Week Before

* obtain and send pre-workshop questionnaire to attendants
* download the sign-up sheet from [workshop_operations]() <!-- create sheet, upload to folder, insert link when done -->

## The Day Before

* if you can, set up the room (tables, chairs), try out the projector, check the network, etc.
* check whether you have or need an adapter to connect your laptop to the monitor in the workshop room

## At/during the workshop

* send around the sign-up sheet and make sure to collect it afterwards
* collect feedback from sticky notes
* optionally, at the end, send post-workshop questionnaire to attendants to increase response rate

## After the workshop

* download the registration information from `nettskjema.uio.no`, add one column for each workshop day and add an `x` for those participants that were present; send this excel sheet to the ``carpadmin at swcarpentry dot uio dot no`` list. Please make sure that you send this email from your University of Oslo account (incl. University Hospital, Veterinarian Institute) to ensure privacy regulations are met. If you do not have this type of account, please get in contact with ``carpadmin at swcarpentry dot uio dot no`` and ask for advice
* send post-workshop questionnaire to attendants (even though you may have sent it already at the workshop, to reach those that had to leave early)
* for official The Carpentries workshops, send an email to the Carpentries admin at ``team @ carpentries dot org`` the number of attendants for both days
* obtain the post-workshop assessment form link from the workshop's uio-carpentry.github.io pages, or from SWC/DC admin
* download the workshop etherpad in text format; take out any information that should not be sent around
* for all those that participated on at least one of the days
  * add their email addresses to the [discussions@swcarpentry.uio.no list](https://sympa.uio.no/swcarpentry.uio.no/review/discussions) and the [announcements@swcarpentry.uio.no list](https://sympa.uio.no/swcarpentry.uio.no/review/announcements) lists (ask for admin privileges if you cannot add people)
  * send them an email, see the [template](post_workshop_email_template.md)
