# General

* these checklists are in addition to the ones [provided by The Carpentries](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/index.html) for their official workshops - note that not all workshops at UiO are official The Carpentries workshops
* It is preferred to use the `Bcc` field for sending email to participants - that way we protect participants' privacy by not displaying  email addresses to all recipients.
* email lists:
  * carpadmin @ swcarpentry dot uio dot no --> University Library and some instructors
  * organizers @ swcarpentry dot uio dot no --> all instructors and helpers, plus those on the admin list
  * announce @ swcarpentry dot uio dot no --> all people that have shown interest or have attended workshops + those on the organisers list
  * discuss @ swcarpentry dot uio dot no --> all people that have attended workshops + those on the organisers list

## Initial Preparation

* check the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VwTIFt6Tce4ncJ_x8m4ygzHldF6tYDbAfLLNX5ae8Qg/edit?usp=sharing) for available dates and fill in your name in the column "Lead instructor / responsible"
* add your name to the instructor list under "List values - instructors" below the schedule
* send a call for co-instructors and helpers to the organizers @ swcarpentry dot uio dot no list and ask them to sign up in the spreadsheet
* NOTE: a workshop can only be confirmed if at least two instructors have signed up in the spreadsheet
* generate the workshop website at uio-carpentry dot github dot com using the template from https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template. NOTE: make sure that you are a member of the [uio-carpentry github organisation](https://github.com/orgs/uio-carpentry/people), and *choose this organisation as owner* for the workshop repository when you import the template
* organise pre-workshop meeting with the other instructors and the helpers to go through lesson materials etc.

## A Week Before

* obtain and send pre-workshop questionnaire to attendants

* send post-workshop questionnaire to attendants (even though you may have sent it already at the workshop, to reach those that had to leave early)
* for official The Carpentries workshops, send Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry admin the number of attendants for both days

* download the workshop etherpad in text format; take out any information that should not be sent around

  * add their email addresses to the [discussions@swcarpentry.uio.no list](https://sympa.uio.no/swcarpentry.uio.no/review/discussions) and the [announcements@swcarpentry.uio.no list](https://sympa.uio.no/swcarpentry.uio.no/review/announcements) lists (ask for admin privileges if you cannot add people)
  * send them an email, see the [template](post_workshop_email_template.md)
